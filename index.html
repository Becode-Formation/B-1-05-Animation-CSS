                <p>
                    Ryu is a silent, meek, humble, submissive, self-deprecating, and respectful individual; 
                    which is often juxtaposed against the light-hearted, fiery persona of his childhood friend, Ken. 
                    He wanders the world with the desire for complete mastery of his martial art, and takes both his travels and training seriously.
